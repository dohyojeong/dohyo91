An early warning outbreak recognition system (EWORS) is a system that is primarily used to detect infectious disease outbreaks; this system can be used as a case-based geospatial tool for the real-time identification of hot spot areas with clusters of TB patients. TB screening targeted at such hot spots should yield more TB cases than screening targeted at non–hot spots.\nObjective:We aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of an EWORS for TB hot spot mapping as a tool for detecting areas with increased TB case yields in high TB-burden states of Nigeria.\nMethods:KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation Nigeria deployed an EWORS to 14 high-burden states in Nigeria. The system used an advanced surveillance mechanism to identify TB patients’ residences in clusters, enabling it to predict areas with elevated disease spread (ie, hot spots) at the ward level. TB screening outreach using the World Health Organization 4-symptom screening method was conducted in 121 hot spot wards and 213 non–hot spot wards selected from the same communities. Presumptive cases identified were evaluated for TB using the GeneXpert instrument or chest X-ray. Confirmed TB cases from both areas were linked to treatment. Data from the hot spot and non–hot spot wards were analyzed retrospectively for this study.\nResults:During the 16-month intervention, a total of 1,962,042 persons (n=734,384, 37.4% male, n=1,227,658, 62.6% female) and 2,025,286 persons (n=701,103, 34.6% male, n=1,324,183, 65.4% female) participated in the community TB screening outreaches in the hot spot and non–hot spot areas, respectively. Presumptive cases among all patients screened were 268,264 (N=3,987,328, 6.7%) and confirmed TB cases were 22,618 (N=222,270, 10.1%). The number needed to screen to diagnose a TB case in the hot spot and non–hot spot areas was 146 and 193 per 10,000 people, respectively.\nConclusions:Active TB case finding in EWORS-mapped hot spot areas yielded higher TB cases than the non–hot spot areas in the 14 high-burden states of Nigeria. With the application of EWORS, the precision of diagnosing TB among presumptive cases increased from 0.077 to 0.103, and the number of presumptive cases needed to diagnose a TB case decreased from 14.047 to 10.255 per 10,000 people."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Sub-Saharan African countries, Nigeria inclusive, are constrained by grossly limited access to quality pre-hospital trauma care services (PTCS). Findings from pragmatic approaches that explore spatial and temporal trends of past road crashes can inform novel interventions. To improve access to PTCS and reduce burden of road traffic injuries we explored geospatial trends of past emergency responses to road traffic crashes (RTCs) by Lagos State Ambulance Service (LASAMBUS), assessed efficiency of responses, and outcomes of interventions by local government areas (LGAs) of crash.\nMethods: Using descriptive cross-sectional design and REDcap we explored pre-hospital care data of 1220 crash victims documented on LASAMBUS intervention forms from December 2017 to May 2018. We analyzed trends in days and times of calls, demographics of victims, locations of crashes and causes of delayed emergency responses. Assisted with STATA 16 and ArcGIS pro we conducted descriptive statistics and mapping of crash metrics including spatial and temporal relationships between times of the day, seasons of year, and crash LGA population density versus RTCs incidence. Descriptive analysis and mapping were used to assess relationships between ‘Causes of Delayed response’ and respective crash LGAs, and between Response Times and crash LGAs.\nResults: Incidences of RTCs were highest across peak commuting hours (07:00-12:59 and 13:00-18:59), rainy season and harmattan (foggy) months, and densely populated LGAs. Five urban LGAs accounted for over half of RTCs distributions: Eti-Osa (14.7%), Ikeja (14.4%), Kosofe (9.9%), Ikorodu (9.7%), and Alimosho (6.6%). On intervention forms with a Cause of Delay, Traffic Congestion (60%), and Poor Description (17.8%), had associations with LGA distribution. Two densely populated urban LGAs, Agege and Apapa were significantly associated with Traffic Congestion as a Cause of Delay. LASAMBUS was able to address crash in only 502 (36.8%) of the 1220 interventions. Other notable outcomes include: No Crash (false calls) (26.6%), and Crash Already Addressed (22.17%).\nConclusions: Geospatial analysis of past road crashes in Lagos state offered key insights into spatial and temporal trends of RTCs across LGAs, and identified operational constraints of state-organized PTCS and factors associated with delayed emergency responses. Findings can inform programmatic interventions to improve trauma care outcomes."

This study employed the Spatial Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations model to address the shortcomings of previous studies, which did not account for spatial correlations and temporal dynamics in expenditure forecast errors. Furthermore, it leveraged Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks to predict regional expenditure errors. The findings indicate that the influence of various factors on forecast errors in both the social welfare and health domains necessitates a consideration of the spatial interactions and temporal changes unique to each local government. It was found that local government volatility in social, healthcare, and socio-economic aspects significantly impacts expenditure forecasts. Specifically, regions experiencing significant fluctuations in the basic national livelihood security rate and health insurance coverage tended to underestimate social welfare budgets, while areas with a high variance in tuberculosis patient numbers were prone to overestimating expenditures in both social welfare and health. This pattern also emerged in areas with notable population mobility or significant regional gross income fluctuations. However, areas with substantial fluctuations in fiscal autonomy were more likely to underestimate health expenditures. The forecasting results, which consider spatial interactions and temporal changes, underscore the necessity of considering regional dynamics. Notably, the social welfare field in Seoul and the metropolitan area is anticipated to experience significant forecast errors, highlighting the need for targeted improvements in social welfare resource allocation and policy adjustments in these regions."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis study examined the public’s sentiments about vaccines by analyzing Twitter data during the CDC’s vaccination management planning stage in the United States. Sentiment scores were assigned to each tweet using a sentiment dictionary and the sentiment changes were analyzed over 52 weeks from November 2020 to November 2021. An interrupted time series model was used to analyze the difference in sentiment, which revealed that there was a shift. Initially, overall sentiments were negative but became positive as the stage of general vaccine supply approached. However, negative sentiments sharply rose when the vaccine supply transitioned to the phase of universalization. The results identified two dominant strategic action fields for vaccines providing polarized messages on Twitter and the negative trend was strong for most of the period. The findings highlight the importance of managing strategic action fields on social networks to prevent mass hysteria during vaccine policy implementation. This study stresses the significance of effectively managing strategic action fields on social media platforms to prevent mass hysteria while implementing vaccine policies."

Specifically, it examines the role of containment, economic, and health system policies implemented in China, the United States, and Korea, and assesses how these responses impacted the trend of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The research seeks to determine which policies most effectively controlled the pandemic and how China’s response differed from other nations.\nMethod and Data: The study uses data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) covering 831 days from January 2020 to March 2022. Sixteen different response policies are included as independent variables, while the degree of change in confirmed cases is the dependent variable. The research employs predictive models such as Regression Decision Trees, Random Forests, Vector Autoregression (VAR), and Granger causality tests to identify the causal relationships between response policies and confirmed cases.\nResults: The findings indicate that China’s containment policy was the most stringent and effective compared to other countries, particularly in preventing the spread of COVID-19. In contrast, the U.S. adopted a mixed policy approach, focusing on mask mandates and vaccinations. Korea’s response emphasized school closures and contact tracing. Predictive models show that China’s response policies had a significant Granger causal effect on reducing confirmed cases, particularly through stay-home and testing policies.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe transmission of COVID-19 suddenly shifted most school classes to online lectures, and these unexpected changes often exacerbated existing imbalances by region and school. Our study used land price data as a proxy for regional wealth and empirically examined the inflation of education inequality between the areas with high and low land prices during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. The gaps in the average high school Math and English scores between 2019 and 2020 (Y1 effect) and 2019 and 2021 (Y2 effect) are used as the main educational outcomes. We utilized the spatial difference-in-difference (DID) method to reflect the spatial autocorrelation on the school-level distribution of the score changes. The impact of the online class conversion on student performances was found to be significantly different between the regions with low and high land price and was more noticeable for the Math score during the first year of the pandemic. During the second year of the pandemic (2021), the scores increased in both regions, but the regional gap remained persistent. Evidence-based policies should be implemented to enhance regional educational conditions and resources, which, in turn, should prevent educational inequality across the regions stemming from the conversion to online classes."

Data on population demographics were sourced from the Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS).

The model predicts EMS demand hourly and identifies optimal locations for EMS centers based on predicted demand patterns.\nResults: The results indicate significant spatial and temporal disparities in EMS demand, particularly in non-metropolitan areas. The ST-GCN model successfully accurately predicted response times, demonstrating a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.303 minutes. The MCLP optimization suggests that current EMS centers are unevenly distributed, with certain regions showing an over-concentration of resources while others remain underserved. The findings underscore the need for a data-driven reallocation of EMS resources to improve access and reduce response times, particularly for fire-related incidents and in rural areas. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers aiming to optimize EMS resource allocation and improve emergency response in regions with healthcare access disparities."

The research aims to identify the influence of Medicaid expansion and other socioeconomic factors on health insurance coverage. The key focus is understanding how these variables contributed to changes in uninsured rates during the pandemic and exploring spatial variations in these effects.\nMethod and Data: The study employs a spatial machine learning approach using data from 3,108 U.S. counties for 2019, 2020, and 2021. The analysis integrates several methodologies, including Getis-Ord Gi* Hotspot analysis, spatial weights matrices, and geographically weighted regression (GWR). The data is sourced from the County Health Rankings dataset, and key variables include Medicaid expansion status, unemployment rates, and demographic factors such as race and education level. Spatial random forests are used to predict the importance of variables, while GWR is utilized to estimate the spatial distribution of uninsured rates.\nResults: The results reveal significant spatial variations in the uninsured rates. The Getis-Ord Gi* Hotspot analysis identifies clusters of counties where Medicaid expansion either significantly decreased or, in some cases, increased uninsured rates. The spatial machine learning model highlights Medicaid expansion, Hispanic population percentage, and education level as critical factors influencing the uninsured rate. The geographically weighted regression demonstrates that these variables exhibit spatial heterogeneity, with their effects varying significantly across regions. These findings suggest that Medicaid expansion’s impact is not uniform, being strongly influenced by local socioeconomic and demographic conditions."

    "text": "See Paper Presentation\nObjective: This study investigates the regional disparities in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the uninsured rate across U.S. counties. The research aims to identify the influence of Medicaid expansion and other socioeconomic factors on health insurance coverage. The key focus is understanding how these variables contributed to changes in uninsured rates during the pandemic and exploring spatial variations in these effects.\nMethod and Data: The study employs a spatial machine learning approach using data from 3,108 U.S. counties for 2019, 2020, and 2021. The analysis integrates several methodologies, including Getis-Ord Gi* Hotspot analysis, spatial weights matrices, and geographically weighted regression (GWR). The data is sourced from the County Health Rankings dataset, and key variables include Medicaid expansion status, unemployment rates, and demographic factors such as race and education level. Spatial random forests are used to predict the importance of variables, while GWR is utilized to estimate the spatial distribution of uninsured rates.\nResults: The results reveal significant spatial variations in the uninsured rates. The Getis-Ord Gi* Hotspot analysis identifies clusters of counties where Medicaid expansion either significantly decreased or, in some cases, increased uninsured rates. The spatial machine learning model highlights Medicaid expansion, Hispanic population percentage, and education level as critical factors influencing the uninsured rate. The geographically weighted regression demonstrates that these variables exhibit spatial heterogeneity, with their effects varying significantly across regions. These findings suggest that Medicaid expansion’s impact is not uniform, being strongly influenced by local socioeconomic and demographic conditions."

It aims to explore how geographic accessibility and demographic disparities impact TB treatment initiation and adherence. The primary objective is to evaluate the spatial inequalities in access to TB treatment, focusing on how these factors influence treatment outcomes in a high-burden region.\nMethod and Data: This study uses GIS-based raster analysis to examine the distribution of TB patients and treatment facilities across Akwa Ibom State. It employs spatial statistical tools such as Kernel Density and Log Relative Risk (LRR) indices to identify hotspots of TB incidence and treatment accessibility. Data from the KNCV Nigeria Tuberculosis Foundation, collected between October 2020 and January 2022, provides the basis for analysis. The study also applies spatial logistic regression and Cox regression to investigate the impact of accessibility on TB treatment initiation and timing.\nResults: The results reveal significant spatial disparities in TB treatment access. Regions with higher LRR, indicating a shortage of treatment facilities, show a lower likelihood of treatment initiation, particularly among women. As the LRR increases, the time to start treatment also lengthens, with women experiencing significantly longer delays than men. Hotspot analysis further highlights high-risk zones where the accessibility of TB treatment services is critically low, suggesting the need for optimized ward locations. The findings emphasize the role of gender and geography in shaping TB treatment outcomes."
